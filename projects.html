      <p>
        In the beginning there was Bob. There was also a display of my very
        first work. Welcome to my wickedly awesome project! Ok...ok I know it's
        the worst, but maybe that makes it good? Probably not. Anywho, this is
        my first ever website that displays some of the basics I've been
        learning. Watch for future iterations and track those changes here as I
        apply the latest greatest from what I've learned

      <p>This projects goal was to build out a website that allowed a user to ask a question and output a random “magic eight ball” response. I also wanted to experiment by implementing at least one feature I didn’t know how to previously do. In this case I chose making an image a button

        The technologies used were HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Express. The website is hosted using Heroku. I chose those programming languages and hosting service because they are what I’m currently learning and developing.
        
      <p>The three things I learned in this project: </p> 
        <ol>
          <li>The immense amount of code it takes to write something simple is staggering.</li>
          <li>You can brute force css code to place items where you want, but it’s not best practice for optimal responsiveness of the website across multiple devices</li>

            How to write functions in JS to make a website interactive</li>
